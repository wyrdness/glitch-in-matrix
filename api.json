      "summary": "Named from 'The Matrix' (1999), refers to experiences of reality appearing to 'glitch' or malfunction - including déjà vu, objects appearing/disappearing, people or places changing unexpectedly, and timeline inconsistencies.",
      "full": "Glitch in the Matrix is a modern phenomenon popularized by the 1999 film 'The Matrix,' referring to experiences where reality appears to temporarily malfunction or 'glitch.' Reports include déjà vu, objects mysteriously appearing or disappearing, people or places changing unexpectedly, duplicate people, timeline inconsistencies, and reality seeming to 'reset.' The Reddit community r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix has over 500,000 members sharing personal experiences. Theories range from simulation theory (reality is a computer simulation) to parallel universe bleed-through, false memories, and mundane explanations like inattention. Neuroscience explains déjà vu and false memories are well-documented cognitive phenomena, though some experiences remain compelling anecdotes. The phenomenon relates closely to the Mandela Effect and simulation hypothesis discourse."
